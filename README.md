# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a predictive model to classify whether a person has diabetes based on various health indicators. We utilize **Logistic Regression** for classification and evaluate performance using multiple metrics. Additionally, feature engineering is performed to enhance model performance.  

## 📊 Problem Statement  
The goal is to develop a **predictive model** that determines if an individual has diabetes (**Outcome: 1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic**).  

## 🔍 Dataset  
- The dataset consists of medical records containing features such as **Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels, and WHR**.  
- We split the dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing**.  

## 🚀 Main Task: Predictive Modeling  
✔ **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables.  
✔ **Model Selection:** Train a **Logistic Regression** model.  
✔ **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - **Accuracy**  
   - **Precision**  
   - **Recall**  
   - **F1-score**  
✔ **Feature Selection:** Identify the most impactful variables.  
✔ **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model using **GridSearchCV**.  

## 🎯 Add-On Task: Feature Engineering  
1. **BMI Classification:** Categorize individuals as **Overweight** or **Normal**.  
2. **Cholesterol Risk Level:** Derived from **LDL and HDL** values.  
3. **Blood Pressure Categorization:** Low, Normal, or High.  
4. **WHR (Waist-to-Hip Ratio) Indicator:**  
   - **High WHR** (1 if WHR > 0.85 for females, > 0.90 for males, else 0).  

## 📊 Model Performance  
(Add model evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, and ROC curve here.)  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Try **Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks** for better accuracy.  
- Implement an **interactive dashboard** for predictions.
